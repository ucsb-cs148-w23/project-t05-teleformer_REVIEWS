## Response
1. To make linking easier, we will make the link reset to its original position faster when the second shoot misses the target object.
2. We will consider enabling keyboard control for all menu items so that player does not need a mouse. 
3. We will fix the bug of missing Restart button in pause menu.
4. We will modify Level 2 to make the button visible.
5. We will fix the bug of pause button does not pause the game.
6. To make the game mechanics more reasonable, we will limit the number of links player can shoot and make nnergizing link drains mana.
