## Feedback:
- Change text to be more responsive to the player
- Link shooting mechanic second projectile is redundant
- Immediate respawn or respawn with a key
- Figure out how to teach mechanics well (current tutorial not intuitive enough)
- Augment pause menu to have restart and quit options
- More gravity to fall faster
- Pause button does not pause the game

1. The product is a game with traditional platforming elements. It adds a twist by allowing the user to form telekinetic "links" with the environment to solve puzzles. I liked the idea of having different types of links the player can choose from to solve the puzzle in unique and creative ways. However, I think the current tutorials for the links (including the basic one) may be confusing for the player and could be more explicit. 
2. The kanban board was very organized, with clear user stories and issues that directly related and aligned with the features of the product. 
3. The README was also very clear and concise, with detailed instructions for deployment, list of technologies/dependencies needed, and a list of team members.
4. Closing thoughts: My favorite feature of the game is the inclusion of different links; for improvement, I think focusing on fewer links types and refining gameplay for those links would lead to a more challenging experience for the player. Lastly, I enjoyed the addition of background music--it made the gameplay feel more immersive.
